### A simple app to keep the CPU cores busy and not idle!

![Alt Text](./light-weight.gif)

## The Problem
I had built a "hackintosh" and noticed my sound would hiccup when the cpu was largely idle.
## The Solution

I set this to run upon system startup, and it nullified the sound issue, while not putting an appreciable load on the computer to do so.
